# Human Centered Design

For this subject I am going to make a chat app with a focus on the user and how he can express himself stronger with emotion and body language. The user I am going to focus on is Eric, he is an electric wheelchair user. So I will be making this app for him, so he can express himself better in chat apps.

> For Eric are Emoji's not enough. He wants better and stronger tools to use emotion and body language in chat apps like Signal.
